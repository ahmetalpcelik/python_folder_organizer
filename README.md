Python Folder Organizer

The purpose of this program is to automate the organization easily by making separate folders according to the extension type of the files accumulated on the desktop. 

It's a pretty simple python code, but I couldn't find it on the web and thought I'd do it myself. You are free to use the code, reference me please.

The code is **NOT** fully automatic. You have to edit it and bring it to the format you need. If anyone wants to try to make it fully automatic, they are free to use my code as a source. 

The important thing is that we benefit people. Let's make the world and our desktops more liveable!
