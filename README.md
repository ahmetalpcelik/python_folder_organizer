Python Folder Organizer

The purpose of this program is to automate the organization easily by making separate folders according to the extension type of the files accumulated on the desktop. 

It's a pretty simple python code, but I couldn't find it on the web and thought I'd do it myself. You are free to use the code, reference me please.
